# GitHub Actions Dashboard UserScript

This UserScript enhances the GitHub Actions overview page for any public repository by providing a modern, grouped, and visually appealing dashboard of all workflows.

## Features

- Replaces the default public repo Actions overview with a responsive dashboard.
- Groups workflows by their naming convention (`Group - Category - Name`).
- Displays each workflow as a clickable box linking to its Actions UI.
- Shows the current status (e.g., passing, failing) next to each workflow using the workflow badge.
- Supports both light and dark mode, with a toggle and persistent theme choice.
- Automatically works on any repository's `/actions` page.
- Build script compiles everything into a single Tampermonkey-compatible userscript.

## Installation

1. Install the [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) browser extension if you haven't already.
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Run `./build-tampermonkey.sh` to generate the final userscript in `output/github-actions-dashboard.user.js`.
4. In Tampermonkey, create a new script and paste the contents of `output/github-actions-dashboard.user.js`.
5. Save the script.
6. Visit any GitHub repository's `/actions` page to see the dashboard in action.

## How it Works

- The script detects the current repository from the URL and fetches its workflows using the GitHub API.
- Workflows are grouped and displayed in a grid, with clickable links to their Actions UI.
- The status of each workflow is fetched from its badge SVG and shown next to the name.
- The dashboard is styled to blend with GitHub's UI and supports both light and dark themes.
- The codebase is modular for easy development, but the build script outputs a single userscript for Tampermonkey.

## Development

- Source files are in the `src/` directory:
  - `dashboard-style.css` — All dashboard CSS
  - `dashboard-utils.js` — Utility functions (e.g., robust fetch)
  - `dashboard-ui.js` — UI rendering and DOM logic
  - `index.js` — Main entry point
- The build script (`build-tampermonkey.sh`) concatenates and processes these files into `output/github-actions-dashboard.user.js`.
- Edit the source files for development, then run the build script to update the userscript.
